// To clarify, in JavaScript, the && operator returns the value of the right-hand side if the left-hand side is truthy. Otherwise, it returns the value of the left-hand side.

// Therefore, when the left-hand side is 0 or NaN, it will be considered falsy, and the && operator will return that value instead of rendering nothing. This can lead to unexpected results, as you mentioned.

// To correctly handle these scenarios, you should always make sure the left side is a boolean expression. As you suggested, you can use a comparison like messageCount > 0 to ensure the left side is a boolean value:

//To test the condition, JavaScript converts the left side to a boolean automatically. However, if the left side is 0, then the whole expression gets that value (0), and React will happily render 0 rather than nothing.

//pitfall of using this is we cant use 0 or NaN as it will render it because the behaviour of && is it will render the first value if its false so if ifs 0 or NAN it will render it
